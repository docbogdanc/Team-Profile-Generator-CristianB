# Team-Profile-Generator-CristianB


Team Profile Generator - part of Bootcamp challenge


## Description

This Project was created for bootcamp challenge.

It tests the knowledge gained in NodeJS, NPMs, Jest, Constructors and Classes,  JavaScript and JQuery during the last weeks, especially the implementation of NodeJS with constructors and classes. It is a Node.js command-line application that takes the user input about employees on a software engineering team, then generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person (index.html). The code can be tested with Jest.

This is how it looks in the terminal:
